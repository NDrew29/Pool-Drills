        <h2>Offensive Skills Evaluation</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this drill is to evaluate your offensive skills (shot making, position play, handling of clusters and problem balls, and breaking) and assign a 1-10 (or A-D) rating to those skills.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Shoot 5 or 10 racks of 9-ball, with ball-in-hand after the break. Continue shooting after the break until you miss a shot or scratch, and record the number of balls made. Add an additional point if one of the balls made was the 9-ball.</p>
        <p>Here are some additional specific rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Break from anywhere behind the head-string (i.e., in the “kitchen”).</li>
            <li>You must always hit the lowest numbered ball first, although balls can be pocketed in any order (i.e., play typical “rotation”).</li>
            <li>After the break, place the cue ball anywhere you want on the table (i.e., “ball in hand”).</li>
            <li>If you scratch on the break, you must spot the balls made; otherwise, all balls made on the break count.</li>
            <li>If you pocket the 9-ball early (even on the break), you must still attempt to run the remaining balls.</li>
            <li>The rack is over when you miss or scratch on a shot after the break. Balls made on a scratch don’t count.</li>
        </ul>
